# division-loadout

### DEMO >>> http://division.devalx.com

Author: Alex (devalx)

I started this project because i wanted to plan my loadout for "the Division". 
So the (first) purpose of this App is to actually plan items by using blueprints data.

If you like this project, Star it! :-)

# Features
- Uses blueprints to assist user in creation of only "valid" items
- Summary of all attributes of all planned items on the right side

# Roadmap and Ideas

There is still A LOT to do in the current version, fixing bugs, optimizing current features and much more.
But i already have some ideas and new features in my mind which (maybe) get implmented sometime in the future:

* Sharing a particular item by URL
* Sharing complete Loadout
* Save/Load items or loadouts
* Compare two items (Kneepads vs Kneepads for example)
* Compare two complete loadouts
* Calculator for DPS which actually is useful. I dont like the formula (or whatever) of the current ingame calculator for DPS, 
so maybe here its best to let the user decide how to actually calculate the DPS. 
This could also mean to actually "replay" some user actions: "headshot_on_elite"->"headshot_on_elite"->"bodyshot_on_elite" ... . 
All talents and attributes would be integrated into the calculation (think of the SentrysCall talent: It will increase damage after a Headshot)
This way the community could find an actual calculation (or replay of actions) which is useful. You could also use multiple ones (PvE and PvP for example)
* Editing/Reporting blueprints so the blueprints can mostly be managed by the community
* Some people like to include stuff into their signature, so maybe make it possible to generate some pictures, either from a single item or a complete loadout?
* Comments?


# Contribute  
There are several ways you can help me out and i would be very happy if you do! :-)

### General Game Data
There are many icons for gear, sets or weapons in-game, it would be nice to use something comparable here. 
Maybe someone can ask MASSIVE for permission to use those icons in this app too ..?

### Design / UI / UX
Being a developer my skills for designing beautiful UIs are limited.. - 
So feel free to open an issue and post some screenshots of a new design! :D

## Adding blueprints
There are a lot of blueprints in the game and probably there will be even more after each patch/DLC.
It would be a huge help to:
* Check the blueprints for any errors which are already integrated
* Integrate new blueprints! (HOWTO shortly)

It would be great to create an issue here on Github for any blueprint you are working on so 
people are not working on the same blueprints, but thats just an adive ...

## New ideas
If you have an idea which sounds interesting to you, dont hesitate to create an "Issue" here in Github, 
post it on reddit or message me! 

### Sourcecode
Built with Angular2, Typescript and a little bit of Bootstrap 4.

The sourcecode will be released soon.
